Open and read a file of integers into an array that is created with the first integer telling you how many to read.

So  4  9  11  12  15  would mean create an int array size 4 and read in the remaining 4 values into data[].

Then compute their average as a double and their max  as an int.  Print all this out neatly to the screen and to an output file named answer-hw3.
