Option 1 (General) 

Use the linear linked list code to store a randomly generated set of 100 integers.  Now write a routine that will rearrange the list in sorted order of these values. Note you might want to use bubble sort to do this. Print these values in rows of 5 on the screen.

How will this work? Compare two adjacent list elements and if they are out of order swap them. After a first pass the largest element will have bubbled to the end of the list. Each pass can look at one less element as the end of a list stays sorted.
